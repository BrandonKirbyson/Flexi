# Flexi

Flexi is an app designed for a school to manage flex periods and share opportunities with students. It aims to make the process of signing up for flex classes easier for both students and teachers, removing the unnecessary and incredibly time-consuming process currently associated with the outdated system. It also allows for school-wide announcements and featured flex opportunities to be shared with students without requiring each teacher to be responsible for disseminating the information.

## What is Flex?

Flex is a period of time during the school day when students can choose what class or featured flex they would like to attend. Flex is a time for students to get help from teachers, work on homework, or attend a special opportunity.

## Why Flexi?

The other flex-scheduling app, Enriching Students, is outdated and not user-friendly. It is difficult to use, lacks features, and has numerous bugs. Flexi aims to fix these issues and provide a better experience for students, teachers, and school administrators. Flexi has a modern design and many ease-of-use features that make flex less of a time-consuming burden for everyone involved, allowing students to waste less time. Additionally, Flexi is free, unlike the estimated cost of Enriching Students, which is $150,000 for our school.

## Features

Flexi has many features for students, teachers, and school administrators. Below are some of the features that Flexi offers, with more to be added as the app is developed.

## Development

Flexi is currently in development. The app is being built using SvelteKit, TypeScript, Supabase, and a custom API to secure student data. The app will be available for web, and if time allows, a mobile app for students may be built to allow important notifications and an easier scheduling process.
